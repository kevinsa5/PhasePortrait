# PhasePortrait
A simple phase portrait plotter for general 2x2 nonlinear 1st order systems.  It is written in the [Processing programming language](https://processing.org/).

See it in action [here](http://kevbase.com/phase/).

Click on the window to start a path at that point.  The path will end when it reaches the maximum number of iterations or goes outside the plot canvas.

Integration uses simple Forward Euler, which introduces some inaccuracy.  It's suggested to use this only for qualitative purposes.
